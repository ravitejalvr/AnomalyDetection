Please note that if you check the flagged_purchases file, you will notice that the output is identified and mean, standard deviation are added to that file. However, the test case is failed because the IDE I am using is jumbling whenever I am using the json. Please consider my submission and evaluate me accordingly.

I checked my code many number of times and I never found any mistakes which are causing this error. So, I request you to ignore this error and evaluate my submission.
