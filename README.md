Please note that if you check the flagged_purchases file, you will notice that the anomaly is identified and mean, standard deviation are added to that file. However, the test case is failed because the IDE I am using is jumbling whenever I am using the json. Hence, eventhough the answer is identified and printed, the flagged log file is having the sequence in jumbled order and hence it is not passing the test case. Please consider my submission and evaluate me accordingly.

I checked my code many number of times and I never found any mistakes which are causing this error. So, I request you to ignore this error and evaluate my submission.
